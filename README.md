# Stock-Simulator
Stock-Simulator is an experimental project that uses a mini-DSL and fluent interfaces to facilitate building a stock market simulator.

I created it to learn about Boo (a language compatible with .NET) and experiment with building a DSL and fluent interfaces.
Although the simulation behaves...randomly and, um, lacks both algorithmic design and (cough cough) good coding practices (those are understatements), I still learned more about DSLs and how their readability can be useful for domain experts with minimal coding experiences.

Technical highlights used in DSL: AST macros and anonymous function.
